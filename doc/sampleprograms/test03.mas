; dimm an LED using PWM (Pulse width
; modulation). The light level of the
; LED can be changed via an potentiometer.
;
; For more information about PWM, take
; a look at testprogram 02.
; =====================================

main:
	adc	w0, 11	; Read potentiometer value into the higher byte
			; of w0, which is b1.
			; This value will be used as T-on.
	
	mov	w1, w0	; copy T-on to T-off
	inv	b3	; T-on + T-off = 255

	high	3	; turn the LED on
	delay	w0	; wait for T-on
	low	3	; turn the LED off
	delay	w1	; wait for T-off

	jmp	main
